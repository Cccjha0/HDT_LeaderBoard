# HDT_LeaderBoard
This project was modified from [HDT_BGrank](https://github.com/IBM5100o/HDT_BGrank).

A Chinese Hearthstone battlegrounds plugin help you to search opponents' MMR.

This is a plugin for the [HDT](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker), and works in the hearthstone battlegrounds.

Once the match has started, slide the mouse cursor over each person's avatar on the left and the MMR information will be displayed.

You can move the panel by dragging it, or zoom in and out by rolling your mouse.

Since the China Leaderboard only records players ranked up to 500.

Players ranked outside of 500 will show 500+.

If there is a player with the same name, the player with the highest MMR will be selected.

If an opponent has the same name as a top 500 player, their ranking and score will be displayed, so the actual results displayed may not be accurate and are for reference only.
